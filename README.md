# Motion-control-of-robotic-arm-UR5-based-on-MATLAB-and-Coppeliasim
Introduction
-----
This project is about forward and reverse dynamics calculation of UR5 manipulator.

Install
-----
* Install'MATLAB'from https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/matlab.html
* install'Coppeliasim' from https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/coppeliaSim
* install 'Robotics Toolbox'from https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/

Model Download
-----
For someone who don't familiar with URDF, you can use STL file of UR5, download from https://www.universal-robots.cn/technical-files/ .Actually you can use UR5 in Coppeliasim directly, but if you want to try to import UR5 into Coppeliasim, you can download it and have a try.

How to run
----
1.open the file "UR5_TEST".

2.open the file "UR5__inverse_kinematics_main".

3.click "start/resume simulation" button in coppeliasim.

4.click "run" button in Matlab.
